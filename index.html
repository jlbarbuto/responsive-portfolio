                        Hi! I'm Jamie and I am curently learning all the awesome skills it takes to become a full stack web developer!
                        I graduated from North Carolina State University in May of '16 with a BS in Textile Engineering. I also acquired
                        a minor in Industrial Engineering. I recently ended a self-proclaimed gap year where I backpacked around Europe and
                        later worked at the Walt Disney World Resort. I'm super excited to put my new skills, degree, and recent life
                        lessons to use and build a new career.
                    <br>
                    <br>    
                        If you want to know a little more about me, here are some fun facts! If I could have any super power it would be to have an internal GPS so I would never be lost again and always know
                        the best route to take. I'm a big fan of dessert as well as traveling. Growing up, I loved performing, specifically 
                        in the form of dance. I've dabbled in several eclectic dance styles including modern, ballet, african, and tap. Shoot me an email if you would like to get in contact. I look forward to hearing from you!
                    </p>
